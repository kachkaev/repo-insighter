## Commands

```text
npx repo-insighter            [--repo PATH] [--port N] [--no-open]   # scan + index + dashboard
npx repo-insighter scan       [--repo PATH] [--collectors a,b] [--sample POLICY] [--max-commits N] [--force]
npx repo-insighter index      [--repo PATH]
npx repo-insighter dashboard  [--repo PATH] [--port N] [--open]
npx repo-insighter status     [--repo PATH]
npx repo-insighter collectors
npx repo-insighter gc         [--repo PATH] [--unreachable] [--stale] [--collectors a,b] [--dry-run] [--yes]
npx repo-insighter report     [--repo PATH] [--out PATH] [--open]
npx repo-insighter query      [--repo PATH] [--json] "<sql>"
npx repo-insighter mcp        [--repo PATH]
```

- **`scan`** — the map phase. Enumerates commits, decides which (commit, collector) pairs still need work, runs collectors and fills the catalog with raw snapshots. Safe to interrupt and re-run; shows progress and an ETA. Flags to scope work: `--collectors`, `--sample` (see [collectors](04-collectors.md)), `--since`, `--max-commits`.
- **`index`** — the reduce phase. Normalizes raw snapshots into the SQLite cube. Fast, idempotent, re-runnable from scratch (`--rebuild`) since raw data is the source of truth.
- **`status`** — inspects the catalog: which collectors have run over which commit ranges, catalog size, index freshness. The "where am I?" command for the multi-step workflow.
- **`report`** — exports the dashboard as one self-contained HTML file (bundle + data inlined) for sharing and presentations.
- **`query`** — escape hatch: run a read-only SQL query against the cube and print rows (table or `--json`).
- **`mcp`** — serve the cube over the Model Context Protocol (stdio) with `schema` and `query` tools, so AI agents can explore a scanned repository.

Bare `repo-insighter` with no subcommand runs `scan` + `index` + `dashboard` in sequence — the zero-config happy path.

## Conventions

- `--repo` defaults to the current directory; the repo root is resolved via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
- All commands are non-interactive by default and safe to run in scripts; anything destructive (e.g. `--rebuild`) is explicit.
- Structured output (`--json`) for machine consumption where it makes sense.
- Exit code 0 on success, 1 on user-facing errors (not a repo, git missing), with messages on stderr.

## Implementation notes

- Commands are defined with `effect/unstable/cli` (`Command.make` + `Flag`), one file per command under `src/commands/`, mirroring the s20-wifi-setup bootstrap.
- Command handlers stay thin; the real logic lives in `src/lib/` so it can be unit-tested without spawning the CLI.
